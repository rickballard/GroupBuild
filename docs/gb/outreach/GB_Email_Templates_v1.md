## 1. Outreach to potential participants (short)

Subject: Small circles for navigating AI-era change

Hi [Name],

A lot of people are quietly worried about how AI is changing their work.
Some feel like their jobs are being hollowed out or might disappear.

GroupBuild is running small circles (6–10 people, 6–8 weeks) where people:

- Share what is happening in their work.
- Use AI tools together to explore options.
- Run small weekly experiments instead of staying frozen.

If that sounds useful, you can share what you are navigating here:

No promises, no hype — just a structured way to move together.

## 2. Outreach to a community lead

Subject: A simple circle format your community can host

Hi [Name],

I help run GroupBuild, which focuses on small circles for people navigating AI-driven change.

We are looking for a few communities to host early circles. The format is simple:

- 6–10 people
- 6–8 weekly sessions
- Light facilitation and shared prompts
- AI tools used as thinking partners, not as the main attraction

My sense is that some of your members might be:

- Worried about their roles or industries.
- Unsure how to respond to AI without burning out.

If you are curious, I would be happy to share a one-page outline and see whether a pilot circle could fit.

Best,
[Your name]


## 3. Outreach to a potential sponsor

Subject: Sponsoring small circles for AI-era reinvention

Hi [Name],

I am writing about GroupBuild, a small initiative that runs circles where people affected by AI-driven change support each other and design small steps forward.

We are looking for a small number of sponsors to underwrite early circles for people who would not otherwise be able to pay.

A sponsorship could:

- Fund seats for a specific sector or region.
- Support facilitation, participant coordination, and light tech.
- Help document patterns that others can reuse.

If this aligns with your priorities around [future of work / workforce transition / community resilience], I would be glad to share a short brief and talk through possibilities.

Best,
[Your name]
