# GroupBuild — Circles for Your Community
## One-Pager for Community Leads

### The problem

As AI reshapes work and daily life, many people in your community are:

- Worried about their jobs or sense of purpose.
- Unsure which skills to build next.
- Overwhelmed by information and hype.
- Tired of scrolling and looking for real conversation.

### What GroupBuild offers

GroupBuild provides a simple, structured circle format you can host for your community:

- 6–10 people per circle.
- 6–8 weekly sessions (60–90 minutes).
- Light facilitation, clear norms.
- Shared use of AI tools as thinking partners.

You bring the people and context. GroupBuild brings the format, prompts, and support.

### What a circle looks like

- Opening check-in.
- Review of last week's experiments.
- Group exploration using AI on one or two stories.
- Setting new experiments for the coming week.
- Closing reflection.

### Why it works

- People feel seen and supported.
- AI is demystified in a small, human setting.
- Participants take small, real steps instead of staying frozen.

### How you can host

- Identify 6–10 members who are interested.
- Nominate a facilitator (or co-facilitators).
- Use GroupBuild's templates for invitations, norms, and session structure.
- Optionally join a host circle to share learnings with other hosts.

### What you need

- A video platform (or physical room) and shared notes.
- A commitment to show up consistently for the 6–8 weeks.
- Basic comfort with AI tools (we provide prompts and support).

### Next steps

- Contact GroupBuild to share who you serve and what you are seeing.
- Co-design a pilot circle that fits your people.
- Run the circle, learn together, and decide what to do next.
