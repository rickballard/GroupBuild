# GroupBuild — Reinvent Yourself Together
## One-Pager for Funders and Sponsors

### What GroupBuild is

GroupBuild hosts small circles where people navigating AI-driven change support each other,
use AI tools together, and turn anxiety into action.

Each circle runs for 6–8 weeks, with 6–10 participants and a light facilitation structure.

### Who it serves

- Workers whose roles are being reshaped or erased by AI.
- People who sense upcoming disruption and want to move before the floor falls away.
- Communities and member-based organizations that want a humane format to support their people.

### Why circles, not just tools

- Most people do not need another app; they need peers who show up.
- Small circles create enough trust for honest conversations about fear, identity, and risk.
- Shared AI use in-session helps people experiment safely and avoid being left behind.

### What happens in a circle

- Weekly 60–90 minute meetings.
- Participants share what they tried the previous week, what happened, and what they learned.
- The group uses AI to explore options, prepare outreach, and generate small experiments.
- Each person leaves with 1–2 concrete commitments for the next week.

### What funding can do

Funders and sponsors can:

- Underwrite seats for people most affected by AI in specific sectors or regions.
- Support pilots in partnership with unions, associations, or community groups.
- Help document and share patterns that others can reuse.

Funding can cover:

- Participant support and coordination.
- Facilitation training and stipends.
- Light technology and logistics.

### What success looks like

Near-term:

- Participants report increased clarity, agency, and connection.
- Concrete experiments run (conversations, applications, projects, learning sprints).
- Stories emerge that show the path from anxiety to action.

Longer-term:

- Patterns that can be replicated in other communities.
- Infrastructure that can also support collective projects and advocacy work.

### How to engage

- Sponsor a specific circle or cohort.
- Partner as a community host.
- Join an advisory group to keep the work grounded and accountable.
