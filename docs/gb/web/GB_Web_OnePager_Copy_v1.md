# GroupBuild Web One-Pager Copy v1

This file contains draft copy for a one-page GroupBuild site that presents it as an independent initiative focused on AI-era reinvention circles.

---

## Hero

**Headline**

Reinvent yourself together.

**Subheadline**

GroupBuild hosts small circles where people navigating AI-driven change support each other, use AI tools together, and turn anxiety into action.

**Primary call to action**

- Button label: "Tell us what you are navigating"
- Destination: simple intake form capturing:
  - Name or pseudonym
  - How AI is affecting your work or plans
  - What you hope a circle would help you do

**Secondary call to action**

- Button label: "How GroupBuild circles work"
- Destination: anchors to the "How it works" section on the same page.


## Section: Who this is for

Title: Who GroupBuild is for

Three short cards:

1. **Workers in transition**

   Your job is changing or disappearing. You want to explore options and next steps without doing it alone.

2. **Community leads**

   You already host a Discord, meetup, or community. You want a simple way to run "AI-era reinvention" circles for your people.

3. **Funders and sponsors**

   You are looking for grounded, human-centered ways to help people adapt to AI without hype or denial.


## Section: How a circle works

Title: What happens in a GroupBuild circle

Four steps:

1. **Clarify your pivot**

   You come in with a fuzzy worry ("I think my job is at risk") and leave the first sessions with a clearer direction to explore.

2. **Explore options with AI**

   Together, you and your circle use AI tools to map skills, search adjacent roles, and surface realistic stepping stones.

3. **Commit to small experiments**

   Each week you choose one or two experiments: learning, applying, building, or talking to someone new. The circle keeps you honest.

4. **Track your journey**

   Light-weight notes and check-ins help you see progress and patterns over time. You can keep this private or share parts of it if you want.


## Section: Tracks

Title: Circles tuned to different journeys

Intro line:

GroupBuild will host different tracks over time. The first focus is AI-era reinvention, with other tracks planned as we learn.

Track cards:

- **Reinvent Work** (Now recruiting)
  For individuals working through AI-driven changes in their roles, industries, or identities.

- **Build a Cause** (Planned)
  For small groups that want to design campaigns, mutual aid projects, or other collective efforts.

- **Ship a Side Project** (Planned)
  For people who want to move a project from idea to first users, together.


## Section: Why circles, not just tools

Title: Why small circles

Copy:

- Most people do not need another app or article. They need peers who show up regularly.
- Circles are small enough for trust and large enough for diversity of perspective.
- AI tools are easier to use well when you see how others are using them, not just when you read prompts alone.
- GroupBuild circles combine structure, tools, and mutual support into something people can stick with.


## Section: Pricing and access

Title: How participation works

Draft copy:

- GroupBuild circles will start as small pilots.
- We expect to offer:
  - Sliding-scale contributions for individuals.
  - Sponsored seats funded by employers, unions, or foundations.
- Nobody will be turned away from early pilots for lack of funds.

Add a simple note:

- "GroupBuild is in an exploration phase. We are testing what works, learning from participants, and will publish what we can so others can reuse the patterns."


## Section: About

Title: Who is behind GroupBuild

Draft copy skeleton (to be filled with actual names and links):

- GroupBuild was started by people who have spent years building companies, working with organizations, and thinking about how AI reshapes work and civic life.
- We are not a hype-driven startup promising overnight transformation.
- We are not a political party or campaign.
- We are a small team experimenting with ways to help people move through this transition with more dignity and agency.

Add a short founder bio block and a link to a public profile page or writing hub.


## Section: Get involved

Title: Start a circle, join a circle, or support a circle

Three pathways:

1. **Join a circle**

2. **Host a circle**
   - Simple interest form for community leads.

3. **Sponsor circles**
