# GroupBuild Web Tracks and Use Cases v1

This file expands the "tracks" concept into web-friendly descriptions.

## Track 1 — Reinvent Work

Short web blurb:

- When AI reshapes or replaces your job, it is easy to freeze or spiral.
- Reinvent Work circles are small groups that meet weekly, use AI tools together, and run realistic experiments to move toward new roles, projects, or identities.
- You do not need to be an engineer or an AI expert to participate.

Outcomes to highlight:

- Clarity about near-term options.
- A list of practical experiments you have actually run.
- A small group that understands your story and can vouch for your efforts.


## Track 2 — Build a Cause (future)

Short web blurb:

- Some people respond to AI-era changes by organizing, not just adapting.
- Build a Cause circles will support small groups designing campaigns, mutual aid efforts, or other collective projects.
- The same circle format and experiment pattern will apply, with more emphasis on coordination and safety.

Outcomes to highlight:

- Shared language and goals within the group.
- An initial plan and calendar.
- Early tests of messaging, tactics, or support systems.


## Track 3 — Ship a Side Project (future)

Short web blurb:

- Many people have half-formed ideas for tools, communities, or services related to AI-era change.
- Ship a Side Project circles will help people pick one idea and move it from concept to first users, together.

Outcomes to highlight:

- A concrete scope and first milestone.
- Early adopters or testers.
- A better sense of whether to continue, pivot, or hand off the project.


## Notes for web integration

- On the initial public site, show all three tracks but mark only "Reinvent Work" as actively recruiting.
- Use simple badges like "Now recruiting" and "Planned" to set expectations.
- Keep the language high level; avoid technical architecture details on the front page.
