# GroupBuild Web FAQ v1

This file contains FAQ-style copy that can be dropped into an accordion or separate page.

---

**Is GroupBuild a course, a community, or a tool?**

It is closest to a community of small circles, with structured journeys. There may be tools and written guides, but the core value comes from people showing up for each other regularly.


**Do I need to be technical or know how to code?**

No. Circles are designed for people with all kinds of backgrounds. AI tools are used as helpers for thinking, searching, and planning, not as something only specialists can use.


**How is this different from just joining a Discord server?**

Most large servers are noisy and asynchronous. GroupBuild focuses on small, more intimate circles that meet regularly and follow a clear path. You get time, attention, and structure rather than a flood of messages.


**Will I definitely get a new job or career through this?**

No guarantees. What we can offer is a better process: clearer thinking, more experiments, shared learning, and a group that holds you accountable. We will be very explicit about what we can and cannot promise.


**How much time does it take?**

The default format is:

- One 60–90 minute group session per week.
- One to three hours of experiments and reflection between sessions.


**How does pricing work?**

Early pilots will likely use sliding-scale contributions and sponsored seats. The goal is to make circles accessible, not to exclude people who are under financial stress.


**Can I join under a pseudonym?**

Yes, within reasonable bounds. Circles need enough continuity and trust to function, but we understand that some participants will not want to use their legal names, especially if they face workplace risks.


**Is this political?**

GroupBuild is about people navigating AI-era change with more dignity and agency. Some circles may focus on personal career pivots, others on collective projects. The public brand does not align with any specific party or campaign.


**Who is behind this?**

GroupBuild is started by a small group of people who have built companies, worked with organizations, and thought deeply about AI's impact on work and civic life. The team will be listed on the About page with short bios and links to public profiles.


**What is the long-term vision?**

In the near term, to run small, well-supported circles and learn from them. In the longer term, to refine patterns that others can reuse in their own communities and contexts, whether or not they use GroupBuild's name or infrastructure.
