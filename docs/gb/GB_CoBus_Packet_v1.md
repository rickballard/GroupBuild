# GroupBuild CoBus Packet v1 (GB20251202)

This packet summarizes the GroupBuild repositioning and artifacts produced across MegaWaves W1–W4.

## Anchor concept

- GroupBuild is framed as an independent initiative.
- Primary wedge: small "Reinvent Work" circles for people navigating AI-era disruption to their work.
- Future tracks:
  - Build a Cause (collective / civic projects).
  - Ship a Side Project (projects and offerings).

## Suggested use

- Treat this packet and the referenced files as the canonical v1 intent for GroupBuild as of GB20251202.
- Any future session working on GroupBuild can:
  - Start by reading the positioning and web one-pager.
  - Consult the roadmap and triage checklist.
  - Use the PS7 helper to sync docs into the active GroupBuild repo.

## High-level direction

- Publicly: GroupBuild = circles for AI-era reinvention (independent brand).
- Internally: design rails that can later support more civic / activist tracks and more ambitious infrastructure, without committing to them on the front page.
