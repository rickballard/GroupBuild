# GroupBuild Circle Guidelines (Public v1)

These guidelines can be shared with participants at the start of a circle.

## What you can expect

- A small group of people who show up regularly.
- A predictable weekly structure.
- Space to talk honestly about AI-era changes without being judged.
- Light use of AI tools as thinking partners.

## What is asked of you

- Commit to the schedule as best you can.
- Run small weekly experiments and report back honestly.
- Respect confidentiality and boundaries.
- Offer curiosity, not fixes, when others share.

## Confidentiality

- Stories shared in the circle stay in the circle, unless the storyteller explicitly agrees otherwise.
- Aggregated, anonymized patterns may be shared to help others.

## Safety

- No abusive or demeaning language.
- No pressure to share more than you are comfortable sharing.
- If a situation feels unsafe, raise it with the facilitator or organizers.

## Money and access

- Early circles may use sliding-scale contributions and sponsored seats.
- Nobody will be turned away for lack of funds during pilots.
