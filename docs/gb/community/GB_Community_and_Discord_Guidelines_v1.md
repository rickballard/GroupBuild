# GroupBuild Community and Discord Guidelines v1

This document assumes either:

- Reviving an existing Discord with clearer purpose, or
- Spinning up a new server that mirrors the circle model.

## Purpose of the space

- Support people navigating AI-era changes to their work and lives.
- Coordinate and support GroupBuild circles.
- Share resources and patterns, without becoming a noisy general chat.

## Channel sketch

- #welcome — brief orientation, how to get matched into circles.
- #announcements — low-traffic, only for key updates.
- #circle-hosts — space for facilitators to compare notes.
- #resources — curated links and prompts (read-only or lightly moderated).
- #open-chat — optional general chat, rate-limited and moderated.

Circles themselves can choose whether to use:

- Private channels per circle; or
- Their own tools (Signal, Matrix, etc.) with only minimal coordination on Discord.

## Norms

- Respect confidentiality of circle stories unless explicitly agreed otherwise.
- No harassment, hate speech, or targeted attacks.
- No unsolicited selling of services to other members.
- Use content warnings for sensitive topics when appropriate.

## Operational stance

- Keep Discord as a support layer, not the main product.
- If the existing GroupBuild server feels like a graveyard, consider:
  - Archiving old channels.
  - Creating a fresh "Season 1" section for new circles.
  - Pinning a clear "Here is what is active now" message.
