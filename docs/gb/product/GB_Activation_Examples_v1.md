# GroupBuild Activation Examples v1

This document lists a few concrete starting scenarios for launching early circles.

## Activation 1 — Single-city pilot

- Partner with a local library, coworking space, or community hub.
- Recruit 12–20 participants via posters, email, and word of mouth.
- Form two circles of 6–10 participants each.
- Run for 6–8 weeks.
- Collect anonymized stories and feedback.

## Activation 2 — Industry-specific circle

- Choose a sector where AI impact is visible (for example, marketing, customer support, or software testing).
- Recruit participants from that field.
- Tailor sessions to shared context:
  - Shared vocabulary.
  - Examples of adjacent roles.
  - Guest Q&A with someone who has already pivoted.

## Activation 3 — Community-partnered circle

- Partner with a union, professional association, or grassroots community.
- Co-design selection criteria and norms.
- Offer sponsored seats funded by the partner.
- Share aggregated results back with the partner at the end of the journey.

## Activation 4 — Online global circle

- Open a small global pilot with time-zone aware slots.
- Require a short written application to ensure commitment.
- Run entirely via video meetings and shared online tools.

## Notes

- Each activation should be treated as an experiment with clear questions:
  - Who actually shows up?
  - What do they care about most?
  - Which parts of the format feel most and least helpful?
- Use the answers to refine both the product and the public messaging.
