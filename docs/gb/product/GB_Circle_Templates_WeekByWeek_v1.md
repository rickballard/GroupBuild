# GroupBuild Circle Templates — Week by Week v1

Baseline template for a 6-week Reinvent Work circle.

## Week 1 — Orient and share

Goals:

- Build initial trust.
- Hear each person's story at a high level.
- Name the core worry or question.

Activities:

- Short host intro and norms.
- Round: "What brings you here?" (3–4 minutes each).
- Light AI exercise: have the group co-create a list of typical AI-era anxieties and opportunities.
- Close with a simple reflection prompt to write before Week 2.


## Week 2 — Map the present

Goals:

- Understand each participant's current work, skills, and constraints.

Activities:

- Quick check-in.
- Use AI to help participants summarize their current situation:
  - "What I actually do each week."
  - "Skills I use or could use more."
- Have each participant define a first small experiment.


## Week 3 — Explore adjacent possibilities

Goals:

- Generate and filter possible directions.

Activities:

- Check-in and experiment review.
- Use AI to map adjacent roles or projects for 1–2 participants in depth.
- Group helps spot patterns and risks.
- New experiments focused on talking to people, testing one direction.


## Week 4 — Design small bets

Goals:

- Turn options into concrete small bets.

Activities:

- Check-in and experiment review.
- Group-based design of 1–2 "small bets" per participant (for example, a project, a course, an outreach sequence).
- Use AI to draft supporting materials.


## Week 5 — Integrate feedback

Goals:

- Reflect on what is working and what is not.

Activities:

- Check-in and experiment review.
- Identify patterns across the circle.
- Decide what to double down on and what to drop.


## Week 6 — Consolidate and look forward

Goals:

- Help participants leave with clearer next steps and a sense of closure.

Activities:

- Check-in and experiment review.
- Guided reflection:
  - "What did I learn about myself?"
  - "What feels more possible now?"
- Decide whether to continue informally, spin up a follow-on circle, or pause.
