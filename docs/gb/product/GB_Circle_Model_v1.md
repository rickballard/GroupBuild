# GroupBuild Circle Model v1

This document sketches a default circle format for AI-era reinvention.

## Structure

- Circle size: 6–10 participants.
- Duration: 6–8 weeks.
- Meeting cadence: once per week, 60–90 minutes.
- Mode: online (video + shared notes), with optional asynchronous check-ins.

## Roles

- Host or facilitator:
  - Opens and closes sessions.
  - Keeps time and nudges transitions.
  - Does not need to be a certified coach, but should be stable and attentive.

- Participants:
  - Commit to attendance and basic norms.
  - Run weekly experiments and report back honestly.

- Optional AI copilot:
  - Used during sessions for structured prompts.
  - Used between sessions by participants for deeper exploration.


## Session outline (example)

1. **Opening check-in (10–15 minutes)**
   - Quick round: name or handle, one sentence about how the week went.
   - Optional: one-word "weather report" for each person.

2. **Review of experiments (20–30 minutes)**
   - Each participant briefly reports on last week's experiment:
     - What they tried.
     - What happened.
     - What they learned.
   - Group or facilitator asks one or two clarifying questions, not advice lectures.

3. **Focused exploration (20–30 minutes)**
   - Pick one or two participants per session for deeper focus, or focus on a shared theme.
   - Use AI to help:
     - Map skills to roles.
     - Brainstorm stepping stones.
     - Draft outreach messages or applications.
   - Capture ideas in shared notes.

4. **Next experiments (10–15 minutes)**
   - Each participant commits to one or two concrete experiments for the coming week.
   - Experiments should be small and time-bounded.

5. **Closing (5 minutes)**
   - Quick round: one sentence on what feels clearer now.
   - Reminder of next meeting time and any shared resources.


## Experiments: examples

- "Talk to one person who is already doing X role and ask three questions."
- "Draft a short project brief using AI and share it with the circle for feedback."
- "Apply to one role that is slightly outside my current field, as practice."
- "Try one small freelance task on an online marketplace and see how it feels."

Experiments should be:

- Owned by the participant.
- Scaled to fit their actual life constraints.
- Tied to a hypothesis about where they might want to go.


## Norms

- Confidentiality within the circle by default.
- Curiosity over judgment.
- No hard selling of services to other participants.
- Clear boundaries around any sharing of stories outside the circle.
