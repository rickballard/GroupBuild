# GroupBuild Roadmap v1

This roadmap is anchored on learning and credibility, not on a feature checklist.

## Phase 0 — Clarify and publish the frame

- Update the GroupBuild public site to reflect the reinvention circles positioning.
- Make it clear that the project is in an exploration phase.
- Set expectations: small pilots, learning, and sharing patterns.


## Phase 1 — Run 1–3 carefully held pilots

- Design a minimal intake form and matching process.
- Recruit participants for one or more circles.
- Run 6–8 week journeys.
- Capture both quantitative and qualitative data:
  - Attendance and retention.
  - Number and type of experiments run.
  - Self-reported clarity and confidence.


## Phase 2 — Decide how "platformy" to be

After the first pilots, decide whether to:

- Keep GroupBuild as a light framework plus facilitation network.
- Build more software:
  - Participant dashboards.
  - AI-assisted planning tools.
  - Pseudonymous reputation features.

The decision should be driven by:

- Actual participant pain points.
- Capacity and resources.
- Fit with longerterm ambitions.


## Phase 3 — Introduce additional tracks

- Bring in "Build a Cause" circles for people who want to work on collective projects.
- Bring in "Ship a Side Project" circles for those who want to prototype offerings.
- Reuse the same patterns and tooling as much as possible.


## Phase 4 — Explore funding and scale

- Test different revenue models:
  - Paid circles for certain segments.
  - Sponsored seats and cohorts.
  - Partnerships with employers or educational institutions.
- Keep transparency high about where money goes and what impact is being sought.


## Phase 5 — Optional deeper infrastructure

- If appropriate, build more robust infrastructure for:
  - Pseudonymous identity and reputation.
  - Weighted input and voting mechanisms.
  - Safer coordination in high-risk contexts.
