# GroupBuild Positioning v1 — Reinvention Circles

Working name: GroupBuild
Working tagline (outer): "Reinvent yourself together."
Alt tagline: "Small groups. Big pivots."

## Core idea

GroupBuild hosts small, structured circles where people navigate big life and work pivots together, using AI tools and shared accountability instead of going through the transition alone.

The first flagship use case is AI-driven disruption of work:

- People whose current job is being automated or hollowed out.
- People who can feel the ground shifting and want to move before the floor disappears.
- People who are technically curious but socially isolated; they do not want yet another asynchronous forum.

The circle is the product. The "platform" is the scaffolding:

- Simple onboarding that surfaces a clear pivot hypothesis.
- Light discovery that pairs people into compatible circles.
- Templates that guide a repeatable 6–8 week journey.
- Optional AI copilots that help with ideation, search, and planning.
- Lightweight logging so each participant can see their own progress and the group can see its pattern.

## Brand stance

GroupBuild should feel like:

- Human first, AI second.
- Calm, pragmatic, and non-hyped about AI.
- Politically aware but not overtly partisan on the public surface.
- Credible enough for foundations, unions, and employers to consider sponsoring circles.

It should not feel like:

- A generic "AI tool" marketplace.
- A loud protest brand with a single issue.
- A coaching "guru" brand centered on a single personality.

The name "GroupBuild" remains intentionally abstract. It can later support:

- "Reinvent Work" circles.
- "Build a Cause" circles.
- "Ship a Side Project" circles.
- More political or activist tracks if and when that becomes desirable.

## Position relative to the rest of the ecosystem

For now, GroupBuild is presented as an independent initiative:

- No need to expose CoCivium language on the home page.
- No need to explain governance theory or edge-owned guardrails up front.
- People arrive with a concrete fear ("What happens to my work?") and leave with concrete experiments.

Under the surface, the same rails and learnings can feed more ambitious civic and governance work later.

## Target users v1

1. Individuals:
   - Age 25–65.
   - Feeling that AI is already changing their work or will soon.
   - Not sure which direction to move.
   - Want peers and structure more than they want yet another article or tool.

2. Community leads:
   - Already run a Discord, meetup, or online community.
   - Want to host "AI-era reinvention" circles for their members.
   - Need a simple format and lightweight tooling.

3. Funders and sponsors:
   - Foundations worried about social and economic disruption from AI.
   - Unions and professional associations that want to offer members a path forward.
   - Employers who prefer to support graceful pivots over sudden layoffs.

## Value propositions

- You do not have to navigate AI disruption alone.
- You get a small, steady group that actually shows up for you.
- You get structured experiments instead of vague advice.
- You get to practice working with AI in a low-risk environment.
- You gain stories and artifacts that you can reuse (portfolios, case studies, pitch decks, etc.).

## Guardrails for messaging

- Do not promise a new job or a salary increase.
- Do not frame AI as purely threat or purely opportunity; keep the nuance.
- Emphasize mutual support, dignity, and agency.
- Acknowledge that structural problems are real, but focus on what people can do together in the near term.

## Naming and language

- Circle: a small cohort of peers, meeting synchronously.
- Journey: the 6–8 week structured path.
- Track: the theme of a circle (Reinvent Work, Build a Cause, Ship a Side Project).
- Experiment: a one-week commitment that moves a participant closer to a possible future.

These terms are neutral and can support both personal and political use cases later.
