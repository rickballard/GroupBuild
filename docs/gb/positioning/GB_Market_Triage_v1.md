# GroupBuild Market Triage v1

This document compares three main directions for GroupBuild and suggests how to treat each in the short term.

## Direction A — Reinvention circles for AI-disrupted workers

**Definition**

Small groups of people whose work is being transformed or erased by AI, meeting regularly with light facilitation, using AI tools together to explore options and run experiments.

**Pros**

- Large and growing addressable problem.
- Easy to explain in human language.
- Strong story for media and philanthropic funders.
- Ethically straightforward to monetize via sliding-scale contributions and sponsored seats.
- Aligned with the founder's strengths in strategy, pattern recognition, and communication.

**Cons**

- Crowded "future of work" and "career coaching" space.
- Requires good facilitation so circles do not fizzle.
- Needs careful expectation-setting to avoid over-promising.

**Recommendation**

- Treat as the primary wedge for 12–18 months.
- Make the public website focus on this use case.
- Run a small number of well-supported pilots and publish anonymized learnings.


## Direction B — Rallies, advocacy, protests, and boycotts

**Definition**

Use GroupBuild to coordinate collective civic actions: physical rallies, online campaigns, targeted boycotts, and similar activities.

**Pros**

- High emotional energy and potential for impact.
- Naturally aligned with open governance and edge-owned power.
- Attractive narrative for some civic-tech funders and journalists.

**Cons**

- Politically sensitive and potentially risky.
- Raises legal and safety questions in some jurisdictions.
- Harder to monetize directly without trust issues.
- Makes the project a visible political actor, which could constrain other partnerships.

**Recommendation**

- Do not lead with this direction on the public site.
- Quietly design rails so circles and tracks can support it in the future:
  - Pseudonymous participation.
  - Reputation and trust signals.
  - Secure communication patterns.
- Consider a "Build a Cause" track later, once core circle mechanics are proven.


## Direction C — Revenue engine for other work

**Definition**

Use GroupBuild to generate surplus revenue that can be redirected into longerterm civic or governance projects.

**Pros**

- Gives GroupBuild license to experiment with more commercial offerings.
- Allows cross-subsidizing circles for people who cannot pay.
- Helps de-risk reliance on grants or donations.

**Cons**

- Can pull focus away from the original mission if not watched.
- Risk of brand confusion if every possible monetization route is pursued.

**Recommendation**

- Keep the mission visible: "help people navigate big changes with dignity and agency."
- Monetize in ways that are clearly aligned with that mission:
  - Paid circles for well-resourced participants.
  - Sponsorship by employers, unions, or foundations.
  - Later: add adjacent offerings (workshops, organizational diagnostics) that reuse the same circle and experiment patterns.
- Make it explicit that surplus can support related open work, without naming specific projects up front.


## Overall triage conclusion

- Lead with **Direction A: Reinvention circles** on the website and in nearterm experiments.
- Design with an eye toward **Direction B: Collective action** as a future track, but do not brand GroupBuild as a protest engine yet.
- Let **Direction C: Revenue** ride along as a constraint rather than a goal: design offerings that are both helpful and financially sustainable.
