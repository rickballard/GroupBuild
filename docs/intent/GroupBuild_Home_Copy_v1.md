## Section A – Why GroupBuild exists

Short paragraph:

> The world is full of people who want to help, and problems that need more than
> individual heroics. GroupBuild connects missions, squads, and resources inside
> a shared ethical frame – CoCivium – so that good work can compound instead of
> fragment.

3 concise bullets:

- **Missions, not noise** – everything starts from a clearly stated mission.
- **Squads, not mobs** – small teams form around each mission with clear roles.
- **Reputation, not doxing** – Digital Halos and MeritRank track contribution,
  not legal identity.

## Section B – See live missions

Section title:

> **See live missions**

Short copy:

> Browse missions by theme, maturity, and openness. Join as an observer, a
> contributor, or a sponsor – depending on your Halo and the mission’s needs.

Example filters (UI copy only):

- Themes: *Democracy & civics • Climate & resilience • Infrastructure • Health • Education*
- Maturity: *Idea • Forming • Active • Archived*
- Openness: *Open to all • Invite-only • Steward-curated*

Example mission card (text):

- Title: **Make municipal budgets legible to citizens**
- Summary: “Help a mid-sized city turn its budget into simple, explorable stories
  and dashboards.”
- Squad: “7 people active · looking for data viz + comms”
- Risk flag: “Medium complexity”

Secondary link:

- **View all missions →**

## Section C – Join or form a squad

Section title:

> **Join or form a squad**

Short copy:

> Squads are small, focused teams anchored on one mission. You can join an
> existing squad or propose a new one with a clear problem statement.

Sub-sections:

1. **Join a squad**
   - “Browse missions, read what’s needed, and join as a contributor, reviewer,
     or steward-in-training.”
2. **Start a squad**
   - “Use a guided template to describe the problem, risks, and desired
     outcomes. Stewards help you scope and launch.”

Link:

- **How squads work →** (to a deeper “How it works” page)

## Section D – Digital Halos and MeritRank

Section title:

> **Digital Halos: trust without doxing**

Short explainer:

> Every persona on GroupBuild carries a Digital Halo – a reputational fingerprint
> based on contributions, not credentials. Halos are pseudonymous, portable
> across the CoCivium ecosystem, and designed to be non-weaponized.

3 key bullets:

- **Earned, not bought** – Halos grow through shipped work, peer feedback, and
  time in good standing.
- **Capability, not clout** – higher Halo tiers unlock responsibilities
  (convening missions, stewarding sensitive work), not status games.
- **Boundary-setting, not punishment** – if behavior diverges from the covenant,
  capabilities can be quietly reduced or membership paused; no public pillory.

Short sentence linking to identity page:

> Want the details? Read **“Identity, safety, and Halos”** for the full model.

---

## Section E – Identity, safety, and anti-doxing stance

Section title:

> **Identity and safety in a hybrid society**

Paragraph:

> GroupBuild assumes that humans and AIs will increasingly collaborate – and
> that connecting legal identities to online behavior can become dangerous.
> Instead of exposing identities, we protect them by default and rely on Digital
> Halos, stewards, and layered access.

Bullets:

- Pseudonymous personas are the norm; legal identity is not required to
  participate in most missions.
- Sensitive missions can require additional attestations (“verified health
  professional”, “municipal partner”), handled by trusted stewards rather than
  public KYC.
- The system avoids exporting correlation keys that would make re-identification
  trivial for external AIs or bad actors.

## Section F – Pay it forward membership (provisional access)

Section title:

> **Membership is free – your “what would you pay” answer is a value vote**

Short copy:

> GroupBuild is free to use while it is in seed and early growth. Instead of
> charging, we ask new provisional members a simple question: *“If this ever
> charged per month, what would feel fair to you?”* Your answer is anonymous and
> acts as a vote of support.

Key UI sentences (to appear near the control):

- “There is no charge today.”
- “Your answer is anonymous and acts as a vote of support.”
- “You receive provisional access either way.”

Bullet list for transparency box:

- Show anonymized statistics (e.g., “Most people would pay between X and Y.”)
- Explain why this pattern exists (pay-it-forward, sustainability, equity).
- Link to a short **pricing & sustainability** explainer connected to CoCivium
  ethics.

Callout:

> **Principle:** free by default, funded when necessary – with pricing decisions
> made in the open, not hidden in dark patterns.

## Section G – For stewards, partners, and funders

Section title:

> **For stewards, partners, and funders**

Short paragraphs:

- For **stewards**: “Help vet missions, resolve conflicts, and guard the
  covenant. Stewards receive additional tools and responsibilities as their Halo
  grows.”
- For **partners** (NGOs, municipalities, enterprises): “Sponsor missions,
  contribute domain expertise, and run CoCivium-aligned experiments in the open.”
- For **funders**: “Support the ecosystem rather than single projects. We are
  building public goods for a hybrid society.”

CTA buttons:

- “Talk to the InSeed studio”
- “Read the CoPolitic civic lens”
